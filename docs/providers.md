# AI providers

[Documentation home](README.md) · [Getting started](getting-started.md) · [Visual gallery](gallery.md)

Queued image generation and opt-in generated video use the [production job API](production.md#durable-jobs).
Video requires an explicitly configured HTTP gateway with `capabilities:["video"]` and
the [video job contract](production.md#generated-video-gateway), including durable job IDs
and client-key recovery. It is separate from the image adapters listed below. Existing
provider keys remain environment-variable references; no credentials are saved in jobs.

Vixl is a headless application designed for autonomous AI agents; humans can use the same interfaces.

Vixl contains adapters, not model weights. Configure only providers you trust; generation can incur your provider's charges. AI inference is called only for an explicit AI command. Provider onboarding and explicit model discovery query catalogs without requesting inference. Provider URL/key configuration is local; it is not loaded from `.vixl` documents.

Create `~/.config/vixl/providers.json` (or set `VIXL_PROVIDERS` to another file):

```json
{
  "default": "local",
  "providers": {
    "openai": {
      "type": "openai", "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "key_env": "OPENAI_API_KEY", "model": "gpt-image-2.5-flare",
      "reasoning_model": "gpt-5-mini"
    },
    "gemini": {
      "type": "gemini", "key_env": "GEMINI_API_KEY",
      "model": "gemini-3.1-flash-image", "vision_model": "gemini-3.8-flash",
      "image_size": "2K"
    },
    "flux": {
      "type": "bfl", "key_env": "BFL_API_KEY",
      "model": "flux-2-pro", "fill_model": "flux-pro-1.0-fill", "job_timeout": 300
    },
    "claude": {
      "type": "anthropic", "key_env": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
      "model": "claude-opus-5-5", "effort": "medium", "fallbacks": true
    },
    "local": {
      "type": "automatic1111", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7860",
      "upscaler": "R-ESRGAN 4x+", "options": {"steps": 25}
    },
    "comfy": {
      "type": "comfyui", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8188",
      "workflow": "/absolute/path/to/workflow-api.json",
      "output_node": "9", "job_timeout": 300
    },
    "vision": {
      "type": "http", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9000",
      "key_env": "VISION_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

Use environment variables for keys; omit `key_env` for unauthenticated local services. `url_env` can substitute for `url`. `VIXL_AI_PROVIDER` overrides the default. `--provider NAME` selects a provider per command. Four providers work without a config entry once their key is set: `--provider openai` (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), `--provider gemini` (`GEMINI_API_KEY`), `--provider flux` (`BFL_API_KEY`) and `--provider anthropic` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or an `ant auth login` profile).

The Anthropic provider uses the official `anthropic` SDK: install `vixl-engine[anthropic]` (included in the Windows installer and the `dev` extra). Images are downscaled to at most 1568 px on the long edge before sending, so Claude's pixel coordinates map back exactly to the document. Describe/detect/OCR use JSON-schema structured output. Server-side refusal fallbacks (`fallbacks: "default"`, beta `server-side-fallback-2026-07-01`) are enabled by default; set `"fallbacks": false` to disable them, for example on platforms that do not offer them. A request Claude still declines fails with `provider_refused`.

## Capability matrix

| Feature | OpenAI | Gemini | FLUX (BFL) | Anthropic | Automatic1111 | ComfyUI | HTTP gateway |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Natural-language plan | Chat completions | generateContent (JSON) | No | Messages API | No | No | `/plan` |
| Description / detection / OCR | Multimodal chat | generateContent; `box_2d` converted | No | Structured output | No | No | `/describe`, `/detect`, `/ocr` |
| Semantic selection / background mask | No | No | No | No | No | Configured mask workflow | `/segment`, `/background-remove` |
| Text-to-image | Images API, sizes in multiples of 16 | Native image output, nearest aspect ratio | `flux-2-pro` | No | txt2img | Configured workflow | `/generate` |
| Inpaint / outpaint / image-to-image | Image edits with mask | Edit with source (+ mask as a second image) | `flux-pro-1.0-fill` with mask; `input_image` edits | No | img2img + mask | Configured workflow | `/generate` |
| Upscale | No | No | No | No | extra-single-image | Configured workflow | `/upscale` |

Detection results are normalized for every adapter to `{"objects": [{"label", "box": [x, y, w, h]}]}` in document pixels.

The adapters have been exercised against real provider services and work well in practice. The automated test suite uses mocked HTTP payloads/workflow responses so it runs offline and without credentials. Availability, model names, accepted dimensions, quotas, and workflow nodes belong to the configured service. Unsupported capabilities fail explicitly. There is no fake-success or placeholder-image fallback.

OpenAI seeds are rejected because the image API does not expose deterministic seed control. Services with preset output sizes (OpenAI multiples of 16, Gemini aspect ratios and 1K/2K/4K presets, FLUX multiples of 16 up to 4 MP) are asked for the closest size; Vixl then fits the result to the requested canvas and records the provider's size as `resized_from` in the layer's provenance metadata. The HTTP gateway, Automatic1111 and ComfyUI must still return exactly the requested size. For arbitrary canvas outpainting, use a provider/workflow that supports the requested dimensions. The `--model` field selects OpenAI models and is passed to generic/workflow providers; Automatic1111 uses its server-loaded checkpoint (it does not switch checkpoints based on this field).

## HTTP gateway contract

Each capability is `POST BASE_URL/<capability>` with JSON and optional `Authorization: Bearer ...`. No redirects are followed. Responses are bounded to 64 MiB; HTTP failures produce structured errors. Image fields are base64-encoded PNG data, without URLs. Vixl will not fetch arbitrary URLs returned by a gateway (only the FLUX adapter downloads its signed results, from approved hosts).

Generation request:

```json
{
  "prompt":"foggy forest", "negative_prompt":null,
  "width":1024, "height":1024, "mode":"inpaint",
  "source_image":"BASE64_PNG", "mask":"BASE64_GRAYSCALE_PNG",
  "seed":42, "model":"your-model", "strength":0.75
}
```

`source_image`, `mask`, `seed`, and `model` are optional. **White mask pixels are editable; black pixels are protected.** Generate returns:

```json
{"image":"BASE64_PNG", "provider":"your-service", "model":"your-model", "seed":42, "metadata":{}}
```

The returned image must match requested dimensions. Vixl clips inpaint/outpaint layers to the selection mask even if a provider changes protected pixels. The request, returned seed/model, source, mask and metadata are retained for regeneration. Providers should return only provenance in `metadata`, never credentials. Credentials remain environment-only in Vixl's adapters.

Vision requests carry `source_image`, width/height, and a `label` for segmentation or a `query` for detection. `/segment` and `/background-remove` return `{"mask":"BASE64_PNG"}` with the exact input dimensions (white = selected foreground). `/describe`, `/detect`, and `/ocr` return a JSON object. Their content is provider-defined.

`/upscale` receives `source_image`, target width/height, and `scale`; it returns the generation response shape. The result becomes a new layer while the original stays editable.

`/plan` receives `prompt`, the inspected document, an operation reference, allowed type names, and `source_image`. Return `{"operations":[...]}`. Vixl rejects filesystem and plugin requests, validates the entire batch, then previews it. Only `--apply` changes the project; there is no automatic execution based on model prose.

## ComfyUI workflows

Export a workflow in ComfyUI's **API format**, not its UI graph format. Keep it as a local trusted configuration file. Values that are exactly `${prompt}`, `${negative_prompt}`, `${seed}`, `${width}`, `${height}`, `${model}`, `${strength}`, `${source_image}`, or `${mask}` are replaced with typed request values. Missing required substitutions fail explicitly.

Vixl uploads source/mask PNGs via `/upload/image`, substitutes the returned server filenames, submits `/prompt`, polls `/history/<prompt_id>`, and downloads the selected SaveImage output via `/view`. `output_node` identifies the desired output. Workflows must save an output image. For segmentation, save a grayscale foreground mask. Wire your workflow to interpret white as selected/edited; model-specific nodes and mask conversions belong in that workflow.

For multiple modes, configure `workflows` mapping `generate`, `inpaint`, `outpaint`, `upscale`, `segment`, and `background-remove` to API workflow files. `workflow` is the fallback. If a job times out, the server may still be running it; Vixl does not claim to cancel remote work.

## Commands

```bash
vixl detect objects --provider openai
vixl detect faces --provider vision
vixl ocr --provider openai
vixl ai describe --provider openai
vixl select object 'the red car' --provider vision
vixl ai background-remove portrait --provider vision
vixl ai upscale portrait --2x --provider local
vixl ai info forest
vixl ai regenerate forest --seed 42
```

Outpainting shifts existing layers when extending left/top and keeps their visual positions relative to the original image. It freezes their current constrained positions while expanding the canvas. Add new constraints afterward if you want further responsive layout. Regeneration uses the captured source/mask, not the current composite, and preserves the layer's stable identity and layout.

## Account model discovery and capability routing (0.11)

Set API keys in your process environment, then register the environment-variable name. Vixl immediately fetches the account's model catalog before saving the provider; credentials are never saved in projects or provider JSON.

```bash
vixl providers add openai --type openai --key-env OPENAI_API_KEY
vixl providers add anthropic --type anthropic --key-env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
vixl providers add mistral --type mistral --key-env MISTRAL_API_KEY
vixl providers add meta --type meta --key-env LLAMA_API_KEY
vixl providers add gemini --type gemini --key-env GEMINI_API_KEY
vixl providers list
vixl models --refresh
vixl models --provider anthropic --capability plan
vixl providers refresh openai
vixl ask 'Improve the headline hierarchy' --provider anthropic
vixl generate --prompt 'A minimal geometric landscape' --provider gemini --model models/gemini-2.5-flash-image --size 1024x1024
```

An environment key for a built-in provider is also sufficient for discovery without `providers add`. Model catalogs are cached in the provider configuration; refresh them when account access or provider availability changes. `VIXL_PROVIDERS` chooses an isolated configuration file. Default URLs target the vendors' APIs; `--url` permits a compatible endpoint. Names in examples are illustrative; use the IDs returned for your account.

| Provider | Protocol | Capabilities in this adapter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | `/models`, chat completions, image generation/editing | Planning, description, detection, OCR; supported image models generate/edit |
| Anthropic | Paginated `/models`, official SDK messages API, `x-api-key` | Planning, description, detection, OCR; no image generation |
| Mistral | `/models`, OpenAI-compatible chat completions | Planning; vision/detection/OCR on models advertising vision |
| Meta Llama | `/models`, OpenAI-compatible chat completions | Planning; vision/detection/OCR on supported vision models. Account API access is required; use a compatible hosted endpoint if needed |
| Gemini | Paginated `/models`, native `generateContent`, `x-goog-api-key` | Planning/vision on multimodal content models; generation on native image models |
| Midjourney gateway | User-provided HTTP `/models` and capability routes | Only capabilities actually advertised by the configured gateway |

With no explicit `--provider`, routing tries the preferred/default provider and then other configured providers for a matching available model. `--provider` pins the vendor; `--model` pins an exact model ID. It does not spend money retrying inference on another vendor after a failed invocation. Providers without discovery, including existing HTTP/ComfyUI configurations, retain their explicit configuration workflow. For a text-only planning model, Vixl supplies document structure without attaching an unsupported vision image.

Capabilities use vendor metadata where available and conservative model-family mappings otherwise. Unknown model families are not assumed to support every task. Update the cached model entry's `capabilities` list in `providers.json` for a verified compatible model that the mapping does not recognize. Supported labels are `plan`, `describe`, `detect`, `ocr`, `generate`, `segment`, `upscale`, and `background-remove`. Discovery reflects account catalog access; it does not verify quota, model quality, or each operation/mode. Provider-native size, mask, seed, and edit constraints still apply. Anthropic cannot generate images; Gemini's adapter does not implement segmentation; inpainting supplies the mask as image context rather than a guaranteed pixel constraint. Preset-size native providers fit output to the requested canvas and record `resized_from` in provenance. Anthropic inference requires the `anthropic` extra and retains its official SDK refusal/error handling; discovery alone uses bounded HTTP calls.

Midjourney has no supported public model-discovery/inference API. Vixl does not scrape Discord or invent endpoints. To use a gateway you operate or have authorized:

```bash
vixl providers add midjourney --type midjourney --key-env MIDJOURNEY_GATEWAY_KEY --url https://your-gateway.example/vixl
```

The gateway must implement the HTTP contract below and GET `/models` returning `{"data":[{"id":"your-model","capabilities":["generate"]}]}`. It remains responsible for Midjourney access and job execution. Merely setting a Midjourney key cannot create official API access.

All provider contracts are tested offline with mocked transports, including native headers, paginated discovery, failed onboarding, capability routing, and credential omission. CI stays offline; the adapters have also been used successfully against the live vendor services. Use `vixl_models_list` in MCP for typed discovery; model keys remain in the server process environment.
